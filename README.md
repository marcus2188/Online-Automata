I handwrite all the code scripts myself. Scripts may not work because they require additional changes if you directly clone this from me. Contact me if you want to try them.

*googleformfillerBravebrowser.py* is a python executable that automatically fills up a google form with all the details specified, with the brave browser auto-popup and auto submits.
